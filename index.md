# 🇬🇧 DEADLOCK UK ROLEPLAY
## OFFICIAL COMMUNITY CHARTER

> **Note:** By playing Deadlock UK, you agree to this charter. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse for breaking them.

---

### 📌 1. THE GOLDEN RULE
Deadlock UK is a **Serious RP** community. Quality storytelling and immersion are our top priorities. "Winning" is secondary to providing a realistic experience. **Play the character, not the mechanics.**

### ⚖️ 2. GENERAL CONDUCT
* **Maturity:** This is an 18+ server. Respectful behavior is expected at all times.
* **Zero Tolerance:** Racism, homophobia, transphobia, or hate speech = **IMMEDIATE PERMANENT BAN**.
* **Communication:** A clear, high-quality microphone is mandatory. Fluent English is required.
* **OOC:** Keep OOC talk out of the game. Finish the scene first, then open a Support Ticket.

### 🎭 3. ROLEPLAY PRINCIPLES
* **NVL (Value of Life):** You must comply if held at gunpoint or clearly outnumbered.
* **NLR (New Life Rule):** If you respawn at NHS, forget the scene and stay away for 30 minutes.
* **Metagaming:** No using info from Discord, Streams, or player IDs in-game.
* **Powergaming:** No unrealistic actions (off-roading supercars) or forcing outcomes on others.
* **Combat Logging:** Quitting to avoid a police chase or RP scene = **PERMANENT BAN**.

### 🔫 4. CRIME & COMBAT
* **Initiation:** All hostile acts require clear verbal interaction. KOS is strictly prohibited.
* **RDM & VDM:** No random killing or using vehicles as weapons.
* **Safe Zones:** NHS, MET Stations, and Spawns are Green Zones. No crime allowed.
* **Emergency Services:** Robbing or kidnapping on-duty NHS/EMS is strictly prohibited.

### 🚔 5. POLICE & REALISM
* **MET Authority:** Respect the Police. "Cop Baiting" is a Fail RP offense.
* **Crash RP:** After high-speed collisions, you must RP injuries using `/me` and `/do`.
* **UK Immersion:** Use UK terminology (Petrol Station, Motorway, Boot, Bonnet).

### 📱 6. DISCORD RULES
* **Integrity:** Discord nickname must match In-Game Name (e.g., John Smith | 102).
* **Meta-Chat:** Do not discuss IC secrets or active beef in OOC text channels.
* **Tickets:** Use `#support-tickets`. Do not DM or ping Staff ("Gods") directly.
* **Privacy:** No recording in Support or Faction voice channels without consent.

### ⚖️ 7. STAFF & DISPUTES
* **Don't Break RP:** Never break character to argue. Play it out, then report.
* **Evidence:** Video evidence (Medal/Shadowplay) is **REQUIRED** for all reports.
* **Final Say:** Staff have the final authority on all rule interpretations.
